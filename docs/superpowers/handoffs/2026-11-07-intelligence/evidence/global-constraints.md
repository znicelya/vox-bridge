## Global Constraints

- 首发最低版本：Windows 10 22H2、macOS 13 Ventura、Ubuntu 22.04 LTS。Linux 同时覆盖 PipeWire 和 PulseAudio 常见配置。
- Live sends translated speech to M1; calls independently route A→B to M1 and B→A to physical output. Facing another person in the room is outside first-release scope.
- 设备名称固定为逻辑端点 `VoxBridge Input`（M1，虚拟麦克风）和 `VoxBridge Output`（M2，虚拟扬声器）。应用不静默修改系统默认输入/输出设备。
- Preserve source/translation role, direction, ID, sequence, epoch and native/local correlation. Do not fabricate sentence pairs, timestamps, provider latency or playback completion.
- Use the approved Taste 2.1.5 `framed-sheet`: 228px sidebar, 48px top bar, white sheet inset 8px at right/bottom, 1px border, no resting shadow. IBM Plex Sans for interface text; IBM Plex Mono for session/device IDs and latency numbers. Colour share stays below 3%, on translated text, data/status and one primary action.
- shadcn/ui primitives and Lucide icons; accessible names, visible focus, labelled fields, required Sheet/Dialog titles. Tool panels move into a Sheet on narrow windows; subtitles remain primary.
- Final transcript, diagnostics, context and intelligence results are local. Audio and service keys never enter frontend output DTOs, ordinary logs, history exports or fixtures committed with real credentials.
- Key entry is write-only: the form temporarily holds the user's typed secret, submits it once, then clears it; saved keys are never read back into React. No key is put in localStorage, URLs, query keys, analytics or generic request logging.
- LLM/Embedding endpoints and models are configurable; SrvDB is pinned to the approved revision. Tavily is the first research provider; suggesting a candidate never performs a network request.
- Every network call, parser, queue, response body, page, worker count and cancellation wait is bounded. No paid endpoints, native keyring, audio hardware or privileged driver actions in default tests.
- Windows/macOS signing/packages, Linux utility behaviour, minimum-OS audio routes and actual paid-service acceptance remain external gates. Browser fixtures are not evidence of real sound or service quality.
